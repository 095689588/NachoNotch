# Nacho Notch

Nacho Notch is a simple app to "hide" the notch on your device.

Please read below for usage instructions and the Terms of Use.

# Usage

Install the app and add the included Quick Settings Tile to your QS shade. Use it to toggle Nacho Notch's functionality.

Nacho Notch has a few customization options. These are accessed by holding down on the QS Tile.
 - Enable Rounded Corners on Top
   - Add two overlays under the status bar to emulate rounded screen corners
 - Enable Rounded Corners on Bottom
   - Add two overlays above the navigation bar to emulate rounded screen corners
 - Black-Out Navigation Bar
   - Add a black overlay behind the navigation bar

These options can be useful for devices which have displays with rounded corners. They can also be useful for devices whose navigation bar buttons turn white-on-white in certain apps.

# Terms

To use this app, you agree that you have read everything in the README document and that you understand it. If you have any questions, please contact me.

Be aware that these terms may be updated. Please make sure you review them frequently. They will be linked in the Play Store description and in the app.

# Behavior and Limitations

Nacho Notch will remain enabled for as long as you have the toggle enabled. It will retain its state across reboots.
Nacho Notch "hides" the notch by adding a black overlay underneath the status bar. Nothing more, nothing less.

However, there are some limitations:
 - Nacho Notch does *not* function in landscape, as doing so would cut content off.
 - Nacho Notch does *not* push the display content below the notch area. While this is possible, it is not in the scope of this project and introduces overall usability issues.

Please understand that, while these limitations can be worked around, those workarounds could cause many other issues.
